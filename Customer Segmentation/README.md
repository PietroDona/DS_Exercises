# Customer Segmentation - :red_car:
## What?

Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing a customer base into several segments.

The most common type of segmentation is by demographic, but there are many other types of segmentation, including geographic, psychographic, needs-based, and value-based.

## Why?

Segmentation is extremely valuable to a business for several reasons:
1. It allows you to conduct more targeted marketing and deliver more personalized messaging to each segment. Young teenagers value many different things than parents of several kids.
2. It allows you to prioritize particular segments when resources are limited, particularly those that are more profitable.
3. Segmentation also serves as a basis for other applications like upselling and cross-selling.
