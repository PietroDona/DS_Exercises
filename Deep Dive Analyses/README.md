# Deep Dive Analyses 
## What?

A deep dive analysis is simply an in-depth analysis of a particular problem or topic. They can be explorative in nature, to discover new information and insights, or investigative, to understand the cause of a problem.

It’s not a widely talked about skill, partially because it comes with experience, but that doesn’t mean you can’t improve it! Like anything else, it’s just a matter of practice.

## Why?

Deep dives are essential for any data-related professional. Being able to figure out why something doesn’t work, or being able to find the silver bullet, is what differentiates great from good.
