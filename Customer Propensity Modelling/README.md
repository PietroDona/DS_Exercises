# Customer Propensity Modelling

## What?

A propensity model is a model that predicts the likelihood that someone will do something. To give a few examples:
* The likelihood that website visitors will register an account.
* The likelihood that a registered user will pay and subscribe.
* The likelihood that a user will refer another user.

Propensity modeling does not only entail "who" and "what" — it also entails "when" (when should you target the users you've identified) and "how" (how should you deliver your message to your targeted users?).

## Why?

Propensity modeling allows you to allocate your resources more wisely, resulting in greater efficiencies while achieving better results. To give an example, think of this: instead of sending an email advertisement where there’s a 0%-100% chance of a user clicking it, with propensity modeling, you can target users with a 50%+ chance of clicking it. Fewer emails, more conversions!

## How to:

Below are two code walkthroughs that demonstrate how to build basic propensity models:

* [Customer propensity to purchase](https://www.kaggle.com/benpowis/customer-propensity-to-purchase)
* [Marketing Analytics, Classification, and EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/jalenguzman/marketing-analytics-classification-and-eda#Classification-Algorithms)

Here are two datasets that you can use to build a propensity model. Take note of the type of features that are offered in each dataset:

* [Customer propensity to purchase dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/benpowis/customer-propensity-to-purchase-data) - A data set logging shoppers interactions on an online store
* [Marketing Campaign](https://www.kaggle.com/rodsaldanha/arketing-campaign?select=marketing_campaign.csv) - Boost the profit of a marketing campaign
